# s3gw

s3gw is an easy-to-use Open Source and Cloud Native S3 service running on Rancher's Kubernetes.

* It complements the Rancher portfolio by offering an S3 service for Longhorn volume backups, Harvester backups, Epinio backups and OPNI models.
* It is deployed on a single pod, ideal for development, Edge, IoT and smaller on-prem deployments.
* It leverages the feature-rich S3 gateway from Ceph but without the rest of the Ceph stack.
